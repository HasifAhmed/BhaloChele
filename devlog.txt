Thoughts- 
I found the article to provide a humorous take on computer science. The part about how when one person 
is doing the work, they can understand everything, but once more people get on it starts to get confusing is 
something I can relate to. I realize the importance of logical variable names and comments to explain 
what needs to be explained. 
Actions- 
- Use useful variable names
- Use comments to explain to not only teamates, but also yourself

Added arrows to component map and assigned due dates to assignments. Pushed new and improved design.pdf
